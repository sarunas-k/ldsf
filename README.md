# Sandbox project using Wordpress CMS
- _Custom post types and meta fields_
- _Developed reusable blocks like post grid, carousel and team members_
- _Responsive to screen size_
- _Revamped LDSF.lt_

During hours spent writing and customizing the code, I learned how Wordpress works internally, how to code custom plugins and blocks and build with it without using popular premade plugins.

## Tools
HTML, PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, JQuery, Slick.js, CSS (SASS), Flexbox, Bootstrap

## Version control, automatic deployment
Git, GitHub Actions
